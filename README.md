# Competitive with Python
These days python programming language usage is boomed, not only due to machine learning and artificial intelligence but also 
due to large number of inbuilt functions which allowed us to break the walls of writing long codes using typical syntax and all.
 
I have seen large number of coders use to work in c/c++ writing codes long ... actually very long which is sometimes less understandable or might difficult to catch due to pointers.
